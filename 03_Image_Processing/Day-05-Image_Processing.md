# Image Processing Theory

## 1. Definition

**Image Processing** is the field of computer science and engineering that focuses on manipulating images to enhance them, extract useful information, or prepare them for machine learning and computer vision applications.

Simply put: converting images into a form that is easier for humans or machines to understand and analyze.

## 2. Types of Image Processing

### a) Analog / Classical Image Processing

* Works on **analog images** (e.g., printed photos, film negatives)
* Operations like contrast adjustment, filtering, or enhancement are applied using physical devices.

### b) Digital Image Processing

* Works on **digital images** represented as matrices of pixel values
* Most common today due to computers, Python, and libraries like OpenCV and PIL.
* Enables complex operations like machine learning, edge detection, and computer vision.

## 3. Basic Steps in Image Processing

### 1. Image Acquisition

* Capturing images using cameras, scanners, or sensors.

### 2. Preprocessing

* Noise removal (denoising)
* Smoothing and sharpening
* Histogram equalization to improve contrast

### 3. Segmentation

* Dividing the image into meaningful parts or objects
* Methods: thresholding, edge detection, region-based segmentation

### 4. Feature Extraction

* Extracting useful information for analysis or ML models
* Examples: edges, corners, textures, shapes

### 5. Recognition / Analysis

* Identifying objects, patterns, or making decisions based on features
* Used in face recognition, OCR, autonomous vehicles
